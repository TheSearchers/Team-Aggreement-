## Summary of the idea 
> We will be creating a 2 in 1 REST API Application that test the GET ADD PUT AND DELETE requests , a web pulse function that determines whether an entered url's server is down or up and running and if its down 
saves the exact same time that it was down in our database so when it will be entered again a last down message will appear , to utilize the Socket.io we will be adding a customer support chat only for signed members .

## What problem or pain point does it solve?
> planning on making it a complete web solutions that will cover so many services which is hard to find in the same place . 

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
> mainly we want it to be able to test the REST functions and the we pulse feature .
